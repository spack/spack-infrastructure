# Spack Infrastructure

This contains code and configuration for Spack's various infrastructure
services, including:

* Kubernetes: [k8s.spack.io](https://k8s.spack.io)
* CDash: [cdash.spack.io](https://cdash.spack.io)
* GitLab: [gitlab.spack.io](https://gitlab.spack.io)

Why isn't my GitLab CI pipeline running yet? Please see our [Deferred Pipelines Documentation](docs/deferred_pipelines.md)

## Secret Management

The kubernetes cluster makes use of [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets), and as such, requires specific steps to be taken in order to create/update secrets.

Sealed secrets are publicly defined encrypted secrets that can only be decrypted within the cluster. Once `SealedSecret` resources are applied to the cluster, the sealed secret controller unseals them, creating a regular secret (same name and namespace) containing the decrypted data.

### Creating a new secret
To create a new secret, simply copy and un-comment the SealedSecret template (`k8s/production/sealed-secrets/sealed-secret-template.yaml`), or any other existing SealedSecret definition, to the intended file. Convention is to name the file containing your new sealed secrets to be named `sealed-secrets.yaml`.

### Updating a secret
Once you have a file containing one or more SealedSecret resources, you'll need to add/update its values. To do so, a helper script has been created, which takes the secret file as an argument. It can be used as followed:

```
./scripts/secrets/update.py k8s/production/**/sealed-secrets.yaml
```

This will prompt you to select the specific secret you want to modify (if several are defined), and which key within the secret's data you want to update (or create a new entry). This prompts you to enter the raw unencrypted value into your shell, which will be sealed, base64 encoded and placed into the file. Comments in the secrets file are not affected by the script, and are encouraged.

If the input value is a multiline string, it can either be specified on the command line with the `--value` flag, or base64 encoded and supplied in the prompt, so long as the `--b64` flag is specified.

Sealed Secrets are *write only*, and as such, cannot be read directly from the definitions in this repository. However, if you have cluster access, you can read the secret value from the cluster.

**Note**: Due to logistical issues with retrieving it on demand, the public certificate is stored in this repository under `k8s/production/sealed-secrets/cert.pem`. This is the *public* part of the public/private key pair, and is **not** sensitive information. The secrets scripts will use this certificate automatically, but if there is ever a need to use a *different* certificate, it can be set with the `SEALED_SECRETS_CERT` environment variable.

### Fetching the private key
There are some situations where you need to fetch the private key from the public/private key pair, in order to decode a sealed secret. In this case, the key can be fetched by running the following command:

```
kubectl get secret -n kube-system sealed-secrets-key-pair -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.key}' | base64 --decode > private.key
```

This assumes the name of the key pair is `sealed-secrets-key-pair`, which is currently the case. However, if that changes in the future, you'll need to use the name of the secret which contains this key pair instead.

**NOTE:** This private key should *never* be committed to source control, and should only be retrieved from the cluster if absolutely necessary.

## Restoring from Backup

- Delete the persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC) for the old volume that's being replaced.
   - `kubectl delete -f pv.yaml -f pvc.yaml`
- Create a new volume from a snapshot in the [AWS web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
- Update `pv.yaml` to reference the newly created volumeId.
- Recreate the PV and PVC
   - `kubectl apply -f pv.yaml -f pvc.yaml`
