# Spack Infrastructure

This contains code and configuration for Spack's various infrastructure
services, including:

* Kubernetes: [k8s.spack.io](https://k8s.spack.io)
* CDash: [cdash.spack.io](https://cdash.spack.io)
* GitLab: [gitlab.spack.io](https://gitlab.spack.io)

Why isn't my GitLab CI pipeline running yet? Please see our [Deferred Pipelines Documentation](docs/deferred_pipelines.md)

## Secret Management
The kubernetes cluster makes use of [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets), and as such, requires specific steps to be taken in order to create/update secrets.

For more information about secret management, visit the [secrets](https://github.com/spack/spack-infrastructure/blob/main/secrets/README.md) folder.


## Restoring from Backup

- Delete the persistent volume (PV) and persistent volume claim (PVC) for the old volume that's being replaced.
   - `kubectl delete -f pv.yaml -f pvc.yaml`
- Create a new volume from a snapshot in the [AWS web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
- Update `pv.yaml` to reference the newly created volumeId.
- Recreate the PV and PVC
   - `kubectl apply -f pv.yaml -f pvc.yaml`
