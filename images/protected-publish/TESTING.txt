There is some curated testing data located in:

    s3://spack-binaries-prs/scott/test-backup

The data consists of two small mirrors of binaries signed with the reputational
signing key (originally copied from s3://spack-binaries/develop/build_systems).
One mirror contains a v2 layout, the other contains a v3 layout.  The v3 layout
mirror was created by "migrating" the v2 layout mirror, but the migration can
tested or run again, see below.

Procedures to test various functionalities of the container follow.

################################################################################
                        Test protected publish v2

aws s3 rm --recursive s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop

aws s3 sync \
    s3://spack-binaries-prs/scott/test-backup/develop/build_systems/build_cache \
    s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop/customstack/build_cache

docker run --rm \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" \
    -ti ghcr.io/scottwittenburg/protected-publish:0.0.3 \
    --bucket spack-binaries-prs \
    --ref develop


################################################################################
                          Test migrate

First update the container command args in `migrate_job.yaml` to contain only the
following item:

    - s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop/build_cache

Then:

aws s3 rm --recursive s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop

aws s3 sync \
    s3://spack-binaries-prs/scott/test-backup/develop/build_systems/build_cache \
    s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop/build_cache

kubectl apply -f migrate_service_account.yaml
kubectl apply -f migrate_job.yaml

Once the job is finished, you can check the logs, then clean up:

kubectl delete deployment -n pipeline access-node
kubectl delete serviceaccount -n pipeline naccess

After this you should be able to:

    - checkout my branch of spack: content-addressable-tarballs-2
    - spack uninstall --all
    - spack mirror add migratedbinary s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop
    - spack -d install pkgconf

... and verify the packages are all installed from the migrated binary cache


################################################################################
                        Test protected publish v3

!!! This mostly works, but it requires spack/spack@develop to have the content
!!! addressable stuff merged to be able to rebuild the top-level index at the
!!! end

aws s3 rm --recursive s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop

aws s3 sync \
    s3://spack-binaries-prs/scott/test-backup/v3_develop \
    s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop/build_systems

docker run --rm \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" \
    -ti ghcr.io/scottwittenburg/protected-publish:0.0.3 \
    --bucket spack-binaries-prs \
    --ref develop \
    --version 3

In this case, the files should have been migrated, but rebuilding the index
fails because we cloned upstream develop (based on the provided --ref), and
it doesn't know about content addressable build cache

If you build the index yourself using the right branch, you should be able to:

    - checkout my branch of spack: content-addressable-tarballs-2
    - spack uninstall --all
    - spack mirror add publishedbinary s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop
    - spack -d install pkgconf

... and verify the packages are all installed from the migrated binary cache,
and furthermore that it's fetching things from s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop/blobs/
and s3://spack-binaries-prs/develop/v3/
